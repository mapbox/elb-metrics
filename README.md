# elb-metrics
Node module which collects metrics from the [ElasticLoadBalacer](docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html) and makes assertions about the performance of the stack, by calculating the number of requests that were 2xxs, 3xxs, 4xxs, 5xxs and the time taken to get back a response (latency).
